# Security Operations

## Elevator Pitch
This is where the rubber meets the road and the practice of protecting an organization and responding to threats comes into play. A lot of operational concepts covered such as what you're protecting and how in addition to responding to events and incidents. Most of the tools used by a defensive centric (Blue Team) role will be covered in this domain.

## Administrative Security
- Least Privilege: Granting people the bare minimal access needed to complete 
- Separation of Duties: Ensuring individual duties are assigned rather than one person having all the keys to the castle
- Job Rotation: Rotation of responsibilities to help mitigate the risks of any one individual having too many privileges. 
- Nondisclosure agreement (NDA): A work related contractural agreement ensuring an individual maintains confidentiality prior to access of sensitve information.
