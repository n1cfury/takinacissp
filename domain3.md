### Security Architecture and Engineering

## Elevator pitch: 
Biggest and most technical of the eight domains. This one focuses on security at the design level. Security Models, principles, and architecture. A lot of content related to applied cryptography. Not a lot on Malware, but does cover the basics.


**Remove later**
The Security Architecture and Engineering domain focuses on ensuring systems are designed securely. Most of the cryptography related stuff for CISSP is covered in this domain such as types of Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption, Cryptographic Keys etc. Various Security models are described as well. There are many more, but Biba, Bell LaPadula, Clark Wilson are commonly used. In addition to security models and cryptography, CPU architecture, Ring Models, and types of Malware are discussed. This is probably the most technical of domains if not second to Domain 4, Communicaitons and Network Security

## Topics

**Security Models**
- Bell La Padula
- Clark Wilson
- Biba

**Security Principles**

**Cryptography**
- Asymmectric Encryption (stronger, but slower), uses public and private keys
- Symmetric Encryption (weaker but faster), uses shared secret keys

**Malware**
- Worms
- Trojans
- Rootkits
- Logic Bombs
- Pakcers

**CPU Architecture**


**Protection Rings**
![Protection Ring](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Priv_rings.svg/600px-Priv_rings.svg.png)
- Ring 0: System (privileged mode)
- Ring 1: Various OS ....
- Ring 2: Device Drivers
- Ring 3: Application/User space
