# <p align=center>Domain 8 - Software Development Security</p>

## Elevator Pitch
Last but not least of the domains, but software is everywhere and nearly everything these days, particularly regarding Information Security. At this high up, there's conecpets covering basic programming fundamentals, software development methods, and processes (not necessarily the processes you're thinking).

## Programming Conecpts
- Machine Code: Code executed directly on the CPU. 1's and 0's.
- Source Code: Computer programming language written in text, that needs to be translated into machine code.
- Assemblers: Converts Assembly language insructions into machine code. 
- Compilers: Take source code and compile into machine code.
- Object Oriented Programming: 

## Types of software
- Closed Source: Software typpically released in executable form with the source code kept confidential e.g. Microsoft
- Open Source: Code is published publicly e.g. Apache and Ubuntu Linux
- Proprietary: Software subject to Intellectual property protections such as patents and copyrights
- Freeware: Free of charge to use.

## Application Development Methods
- Agile
- Waterfall
- Scrum
- Spiral
- SDLC

## Databases (and database keys)
- Super Key – A super key is a group of single or multiple keys which identifies rows in a table.
- Primary Key – is a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identify every row in that table.
- ,Candidate Key – is a set of attributes that uniquely identify tuples in a table. Candidate Key is a super key with no repeated attributes.
- Alternate Key – is a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identify every row in that table.
- Foreign Key – is a column that creates a relationship between two tables. The purpose of Foreign keys is to maintain data integrity and allow navigation between two different instances of an entity.
- Compound Key – has two or more attributes that allow you to uniquely recognize a specific record. It is possible that each column may not be unique by itself within the database.
- Composite Key – is a combination of two or more columns that uniquely identify rows in a table. The combination of columns guarantees uniqueness, though individual uniqueness is not guaranteed.
- Surrogate Key – An artificial key which aims to uniquely identify each record is called a surrogate key. These kind of key are unique because they are created when you don’t have any natural primary key.


## Software Vulnerabilites
- Buffer Overflows: 
- TOC/TOU:
- Cross-Site Scripting/Request forgery:
- Privilege Escalation:
- Backdoors:

## Software Capability Maturity Model
- Initial: Processes are ad-hoc and unstable.
- Repeatable: Things are becoming more predictable. You are starting to iron out what's repeatable.
- Defined: You have a set of standard processes which are used to establish consistency. This is a more formal version of the Repeatable stage.
- Managed: You are now using precise measurements (metrics) to measure quantitative results and progress.
- Optimizing: Most mature state. Making incremental changes based on the metrics you have gathered.
