# <p align=center>Domain 8 - Software Development Security</p>

## Elevator Pitch
Last but not least of the domains, but software is everywhere and nearly everything these days, particularly regarding Information Security

## Programming Conecpts
- Machine Code
- Source Code
- Assemblers
- Compilers
- Object Oriented Programming
-
## Application Development Methods
- Agile
- Waterfall
- Scrum
- Spiral
- SDLC

## Databases (and database keys)
- Relational Databasese
- Foreign Keys

## Software Vulnerabilites
- Buffer Overflows:
- TOC/TOU:
- Cross-Site Scripting/Request forgery:
- Privilege Escalation:
- Backdoors:

## Software Capability Maturity Model
- Initial: Processes are ad-hoc and unstable.
- Repeatable: Things are becoming more predictable. You are starting to iron out what's repeatable.
- Defined: You have a set of standard processes which are used to establish consistency. This is a more formal version of the Repeatable stage.
- Managed: You are now using precise measurements (metrics) to measure quantitative results and progress.
- Optimizing: Most mature state. Making incremental changes based on the metrics you have gathered.
