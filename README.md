# Takin' A CISSP: Dumping CISSP related notes here.

### This repo is a brain dump of various notes I've taken and information I've reviewed while studying for the CISSP. As such it will include content from each of the domains. 

* [Security & Risk Management](https://github.com/n1cfury/takinacissp/blob/master/domain1.md)
* [Asset Security](https://github.com/n1cfury/takinacissp/blob/master/domain2.md)
* [Security Architecture & Engineering](https://github.com/n1cfury/takinacissp/blob/master/domain3.md)
* [Communications & Network Security](https://github.com/n1cfury/takinacissp/blob/master/domain4.md)
* [Identiy Access Management](https://github.com/n1cfury/takinacissp/blob/master/domain5.md)
* [Security Assessment & Testing](https://github.com/n1cfury/takinacissp/blob/master/domain6.md)
* [Security Operations](https://github.com/n1cfury/takinacissp/blob/master/domain7.md)
* [Software Development Security](https://github.com/n1cfury/takinacissp/blob/master/domain8.md)



#### Each subfolder will contain the following:
* Powerpoint Slides (saved as a PDF)
* README.md describing the domain and including the "additional references" mentioned in the slides


#### I'm using to organize notes for each of the CISSP domains based on different resources I've read in preparation for the exam. Will it include everything covered by that domain? I cant guarantee that but it might not be a bad starting point There are definitely much smarter people that have much better content, so why did I put this stuff up here?  

#### To be honest, I wanted to dump my notes somewhere I could reference them later and will come back once I get one of my goals out of the way. While CISSP is an eventual goal, it's not my first one and not my long term focus at the moment. There are no exam questions on this repo as that would violate the rules. I'm including a few links, and real-world stories for each domain for context.
