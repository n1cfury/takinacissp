# Takin' A CISSP: Exam Prep, Brain Dump

### This repo is a brain dump of various notes I've taken and information I've reviewed while studying for the CISSP. As such it will include content from each of the domains. 


* Security Architecture & Engineering
* Security Operations 
* Security Assessment & Testing
* Security & Risk Management
* Software Development Security
* Communications & Network Security
* Identiy Access Management
* Asset Security


#### Each subfolder will contain the following:
* Powerpoint Slides (saved as a PDF)
* README.md describing the domain and including the "additional references" mentioned in the slides


#### I'm using to organize notes for each of the CISSP domains based on a few books I've read in preparation for the exam. Will it include everything covered by that domain? I cant guarantee that but it might not be a bad starting point There are definitely much smarter people that have much better content, so why did I put this stuff up here?  

#### To be honest, I wanted to dump my notes somewhere I could reference them later and will come back once I get one of my goals out of the way. While CISSP is an eventual goal, it's not my first one and not my long term focus at the moment.
