# Security Assessent and Testing

## Elevator Pitch
So, how do you know you're protecting your organization? What do you do to measure your success? This domain describes various methods, techniques, and the process of assessing security 

## Standards
- [NIST 800-53A](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53a/rev-4/final): Building Effective Assessment Plans
- [NIST 800-137](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-137/final): Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM)
- [NIST 800-115](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-115/final): Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment

## Software Testing Levels
- Unit Testing
- Installation Testing
- Integration testing
- Regression Testing
- Acceptance Testing
- Fuzzing

## Penetration Testing 
- Planning
- Reconnaissance
- Scanning
- Vulnerability Assessment
- Exploittation
- Reporting:

## STRIDE: A Microsoft threat categorization scheme
- Spoofing: Impersonating someone or something
- Tampering: Modifying data or code
- Repudiation: Claiming to have not performed an action
- Information Disclosure: Exposing information to someone unauthorized
- Denial of Service: Deny or degrade service to users
- Elevation of Prilege: Gain capabilites without being authorized

## Penetration Testing Methods
- Black Box: Very little known about the target. Assume the tester has zero knowledge of the target in question
- Gray Box: Some knowledge of the target. Assume the tester 
- White Box: Assume the tester has full access/knowlege of the target.
