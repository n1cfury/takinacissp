# Identity and Access Management

## Elevator pitch
This domain foucuses on communications over the network as obviously stated. Less obviously stated, this domain dives into the how and what with these communications are done. Are you going to have to know all 65536 TCP and UDP ports? Probably not. Are you going to need to distinguish protocols or technology used in each layer? More than likely.

## Topics


- Hashing
- Salt
- Encoding
- Encryption


## Kerberos


## Access Controls
- Rule-Based: 
– RAC: Role Based Access Control. Defined rules or restrictions for accesing objects in a system 
- DAC: Users have direct control over all programs and files
- MAC: Opposite of DAC. Using a policy or Hardware/Software component to restrict access


## Authentication factors
- Type 1: Something you know
- Type 2: Something you have
- Type 3: Something you are


## Password Attacks
- Dictionary: A word list, e.g. rockyou.txt
- Hybrid Attack: appends, prepends or changes characters in words from a dictionary before hashing
- Brute Force: calculates hash outputs for every possible password
- Rainbow Tables: a database that contains the precomputed hashed output for most or all passwords

## Security controls
- Detective
- Corrective
- Preventive
- Compensating


- FAR
- FRR
- CER
- CFR
